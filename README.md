## network-monitor
    1. base on the socket/netlink to monitor android's network event: ip/route.
    2. change the android ip route rule for linux servers.
    3. monitor the uevent from kenrel: When there is a change in the device, the kernel layer detects it first, and then sends device events (such as device insertion, removal, and status change) to the user space through the uevent mechanism (based on netlink sockets).
